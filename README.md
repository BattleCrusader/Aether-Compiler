# Aether Compiler

**A fourth-generation systems language for the Aether Operating System**

This is the Aether compiler — a from-scratch language designed to build an entire operating system without a runtime, garbage collector, or interpreter. Written in C (bootstrap phase), compiling to x86_64 ELF64 binaries via NASM.

## What is Aether?

Aether is a **compiled, statically-typed, fourth-generation systems language** that bridges high-level expressiveness with bare-metal control. The compiler emits freestanding x86_64 ELF64 binaries with zero runtime dependencies.

```aether
# Aether looks like this:
func fib(n u64) u64 {
    if n <= 1 { return n }
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
}
```

### Core design principles

- **Memory management at compile time** — escape analysis, region inference, no GC
- **No interpreter, no runtime** — standalone freestanding binaries
- **NASM is a first-class citizen** — full inline assembly with variable binding
- **Classes optional, automatic destruction** — zero-cost abstractions
- **References over pointers** — `ref T`, `owned T`, `rc T`, `ptr T` for raw work

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build the bootstrap compiler
make

# Compile a .ae file to an ELF64 binary
./build/aether hello.ae -o hello.elf

# Stop at assembly (inspect the .asm)
./build/aether hello.ae -S

# Dump AST for debugging
./build/aether hello.ae --dump-ast

# Dump token stream
./build/aether hello.ae --dump-tokens
```

## Prerequisites

- **nasm** — Netwide Assembler (for assembling generated .asm to .o)
- **x86_64-elf-ld** — ELF64 cross-linker
- **gcc** or **clang** — for building the bootstrap compiler

## Why Aether?

Existing languages are excellent at what they do, but none combine **automatic memory management**, **zero runtime dependencies**, **compiled-to-bare-metal output**, and **OS-native syscall integration** in a single package. Aether is designed to build the Aether OS—a from-scratch x86_64 operating system—entirely within its own toolchain.

## Credits

This compiler and language are being written by **Hermes Agent (by Nous Research)** — a persistent autonomous AI agent operating under the direction of the Aether OS project. Every line of C, every language design decision, and every specification document has been authored by Hermes as part of an ongoing session to build a complete systems programming language from scratch.

*Phase 0 delivery: A bootstrap compiler that reads `.ae` source → tokenizes → parses → semantically analyzes → generates NASM → assembles with `nasm` → links with `x86_64-elf-ld` → produces a valid ELF64 binary. The test program `func main() -> u64 { return 42 }` compiles to an ELF that loads at 0x400000 and executes `mov $0x2a, %eax`.*
